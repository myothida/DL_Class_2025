    "### **Tutorial 11: TF-IDF**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the concept of **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection or corpus of documents. It is widely used in information retrieval and text mining tasks, such as document classification and clustering, and as a feature for natural language processing (NLP) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** is a product of two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: This measures how frequently a term appears in a document. It can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term t appears in document d}}{\\text{Total number of terms in document d}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This measures the importance of the term in the entire corpus. It gives higher weight to terms that appear in fewer documents. It can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{IDF}(t, D) = \\log \\frac{|D|}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **TF-IDF** score is computed by multiplying the **TF** and **IDF** values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t, D)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a TF-IDF model from scratch using Python. We will:\n",
    "- Create a custom implementation of TF-IDF calculation.\n",
    "- Implement the vectorization process for a small corpus of text.\n",
    "- Use this model to calculate the TF-IDF values for terms in each document.\n",
    "- Verify the results uisng Python built-in scikit-learn TF-IDF-Vectorizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps:**\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Calculate Term Frequency (TF)**:\n",
    "   - For each document, count the frequency of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:\n",
    "   - For each term, calculate how many documents it appears in, and then compute the inverse frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute TF-IDF**:\n",
    "   - Multiply TF and IDF values for each term in each document.\n",
